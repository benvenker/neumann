# Vector Store Documentation

This document covers vector store operations and embeddings for semantic search.

## Overview

A vector store is a specialized database designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional embeddings efficiently. Vector stores enable semantic search by comparing query embeddings with document embeddings using similarity metrics.

## Key Features

- **Embedding Storage**: Store text embeddings generated by models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
- **Similarity Search**: Find documents similar to a query using cosine similarity or L2 distance
- **Metadata Filtering**: Filter results by document metadata before similarity comparison
- **Batch Operations**: Efficiently insert and query multiple embeddings at once

## Using Vector Stores

Vector stores are essential for building retrieval systems. They allow you to:

1. Index documents with their embeddings
2. Search using natural language queries
3. Retrieve relevant context for RAG systems

This makes vector stores a cornerstone of modern semantic search applications.
